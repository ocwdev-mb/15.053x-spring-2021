  caption: The game of Fiver involves a grid of circles that are green on one side
    and red on the other. Starting with all the green sides showing, in each move,
    the player flips one circle and its four adjacent circles until all the red sides
    are showing. Optimizing the Fiver solution is used to illustrate integer programming
    techniques. (Image by Prof. James Orlin.)
